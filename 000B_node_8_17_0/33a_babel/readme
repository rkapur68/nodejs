In the context of a Node.js application, “Babel Registration” refers to a setup where Babel is configured to transpile your code in real-time as your application runs.

Sure, let’s simplify this:

require('@babel/register'): This line is like telling your code, “Hey, we’re going to use a tool called Babel to understand the latest JavaScript features.”

({ presets: ['@babel/preset-env'], plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining'] }): This part is like giving Babel a list of the latest JavaScript features that it needs to understand. In this case, it needs to understand all the latest features (@babel/preset-env) and a specific feature called optional chaining (@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining).


module.exports = require('./index.js'): This line is like saying, “Okay, now that Babel is set up, let’s start running our actual application code from the index.js file.” Because of the setup done earlier, Babel will automatically translate any latest JavaScript features used in index.js into older JavaScript that your current Node.js environment can understand.
So, in simple terms, this code is setting up Babel to translate any latest JavaScript features used in your application into older JavaScript that your current Node.js environment can understand. This way, you can write your code using the latest JavaScript features, and it will still run correctly in your current Node.js environment.



this example shows  let’s say you want to use the latest ECMAScript features that are not supported in Node.js 8.17.0, such as optional chaining. You can use Babel to transpile your code.
