Yes, you can upgrade and save to a new project folder. Here's how you can do it:

**Step 1: Create a new project directory**

First, create a new directory for your upgraded project:

```bash
mkdir my-upgraded-babel-project
```

**Step 2: Copy your project files**

Next, copy your project files from the old directory to the new directory. You can use the `cp` command to do this:

```bash
cp -r my-babel-project/* my-upgraded-babel-project/
```

This command copies all files and directories from `my-babel-project` to `my-upgraded-babel-project`.

**Step 3: Navigate to the new project directory**

Navigate to your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-upgraded-babel-project
```

**Step 4: Upgrade Node.js**

If you're using Node Version Manager (NVM), you can install Node.js 8.17.0 with the following command:

```bash
nvm install 8.17.0
```

And then switch to it using the `nvm use` command:

```bash
nvm use 8.17.0
```

**Step 5: Upgrade Babel**

Now that you're using Node.js 8.17.0, you can upgrade Babel in your project. You can use `babel-upgrade` to automatically upgrade your Babel version and update your configuration files. Here's the command to run `babel-upgrade`:

```bash
npx babel-upgrade --write --install
```

**Step 6: Run your code with Babel 7**

Now you can run your code with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command transpiles and runs your `index.js` file with Babel 7.






The `babel-upgrade` tool automatically updates your Babel dependencies and configuration files¹². However, it does not modify the scripts in your `package.json` file¹².

If you want to modify the `start` script in your `package.json` file after running `babel-upgrade`, you'll need to do it manually. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `package.json` file in a text editor.

2. Find the `scripts` section. It might look something like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "babel-node --presets es2015 index.js"
    }
    ```

3. Modify the `start` script to use the new Babel preset. For example, if you're upgrading to Babel 7 and using the `@babel/preset-env` preset, your `start` script might look like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "babel-node --presets @babel/preset-env index.js"
    }
    ```

4. Save your `package.json` file.

Now, when you run `npm start`, it will use the new Babel preset.
